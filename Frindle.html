	<p>
		This book was on my daughter's Summer Reading List from school (2nd Grade going into 3rd)last year & I 
		have to say it was enjoyed immensely by all of us! We would have her read a few pages every day to us(for 
		her to practice her reading). We felt it was original & kept her attention throughout the book. The writing 
		revealed the characters as imaginative, unique & steadfast in their decisions. You can't help but like the 
		characters and empathize with their dilemmas. Our daughter would crack up with laughter the character dialogue 
		& would come up with her own new names for things (which thankfully did not stick most of the time). We liked 
		how the book ends with a flash forward scenario as well. It's a wonderful book!!
