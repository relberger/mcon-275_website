			Taken from this review.

		<p>
			Anyone who has a passion for words and wordplay will enjoy reading The Phantom Tollbooth. In this charming 
			children's book, author Norton Juster takes us on an adventure with his main character Milo, a young boy who 
			enters a chaotic place called the Kingdom of Wisdom and finds that to restore order in the kingdom, he must 
			save the banished princesses Rhyme and Reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the story begins, Milo gets home one afternoon expecting to go through the same humdrum after-school 
			routine he always goes through. But on this particular day, he arrives home to find a tollbooth waiting to 
			transport him to a faraway place. Soon, Milo is traveling through the Kingdom of Wisdom, seeking to rescue 
			Rhyme and Reason with the help of his companions, Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug.	
		</p>
		<p>
			Along the way, Milo meets some interesting and clever characters, such as the Whether Man (not to be confused 
			with the Weather Man, "for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the 
			weather will be") and Kakofonous Dischord, Doctor of Dissonance, whom Milo meets on the outskirts of the Valley 
			of Sound. Page after page, Juster's clever puns and witty plays on words make his characters memorable and his 
			storyline entertaining.
		</p>
		<p>
			On his journey, Milo travels to several places within the Kingdom of Wisdom, learning useful things along the 
			way. In Dictionopolis, for instance, he discovers the abundance of words and the importance of choosing the right 
			word for the right occasion. On his way to Digitopolis, a land ruled by numbers, Milo ends up on the Island of 
			Conclusions. There, he decides to himself, "From now on, I'm going to have a very good reason before I make up my 
			mind about anything," and he learns that "you can lose too much time jumping to Conclusions."
		</p>
		<p>
			Armed with the knowledge he has gathered on his journey through the Kingdom, Milo finally reaches the Mountains 
			of Ignorance, where he and his faithful companions dodge and outwit various demons and ultimately save the 
			princesses Rhyme and Reason. In the end, Milo is transported back to the present with a newfound curiosity about 
			the world and a greater appreciation for learning.
		</p>
		<p>
			Juster's humor throughout the story is at times subtle, at times downright silly, but often clever and 
			thought-provoking, making this book an enjoyable read for young and old alike. They say there's a child in all 
			of us, and The Phantom Tollbooth truly is a children's book for all ages.
