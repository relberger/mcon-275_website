		<h1>
			The Kite Runner
		</h1>
		<h2>
			by Khaled Hosseini
		</h2>
		<a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/30/review-khaled-hosseini-the-kite-runner">
			Taken from this review.
		</a>
		<p>
			A gripping and emotional story of betrayal and redemption, The Kite Runner had me thrilled and moved, 
			both at the same time. It tells the story of Amir and Hassan, the closest of friends, as good as brothers, 
			and also experts in the art of kite flying. The two young boys live in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and 
			this year they are going to try harder than ever to win the local kite-fighting tournament—a popular Afghan 
			pastime, and this is Amir's one hope of winning his father's love. But just like the kites battling in the sky, 
			war comes to Afghanistan, and the country becomes an extremely dangerous place.
		</p>
		<p>
			In war, people are often forced to make great sacrifices, and the young Amir himself commits an act of betrayal, 
			towards his best friend Hassan no less, which will haunt him for the rest of his life. Amir and his father are 
			forced to flee Afghanistan for America, and The Kite Runner becomes the story of Amir's quest for redemption – 
			righting the wrongs he committed all those years ago as a boy in Kabul.
		</p>
		<p>
			The story is fast-paced and hardly ever dull, and introduced me to a world – the world of Afghan life – which 
			is strange, fascinating and yet oddly familiar all at the same time. Hosseini's writing finds a great balance 
			between being clear and yet powerful, and not only is the story itself brilliantly constructed, but the book 
			also explores the very art of storytelling. Amir himself becomes a writer, and he reflects on his experiences 
			in the story as though his life itself were a piece of fiction (which of course it is!).
		</p>
		<p>
			But I think the best bit about the kite runner is its sense of fate and justice, of good overcoming evil in 
			the end, despite all odds. Without giving away the ending, Amir ends up back in Afghanistan and makes a very 
			different set of sacrifices in order to set things straight. The final chapter of the book is perhaps my 
			favourite, and one that I have found moving even when rereading it. The message behind the very ending could be 
			interpreted differently by different readers, but personally I feel that it offers a small sense of hope for 
			both the future of its characters, and perhaps for war-torn Afghanistan as well.
