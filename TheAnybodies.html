		What do you get when you add a sprinkle of magic, a twist of mystery, and a slew of colorful characters? 
		Welcome to the world of THE ANYBODIES! First, we meet eleven-year-old Fern Drudger who is trapped in a rather 
		dull life with her tragically boring parents. Mr. and Mrs. Drudger are both accountants at a firm called Beige 
		and Beige. They enjoy dull things only: toasters, sponges, and refrigerator magnets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fern, on the other hand, is different from her parents. She loves books and writing in her journal. Fern is 
		anything but dull and has had some unusual things happen to her. As a toddler, she filled her room with crickets 
		when she was looking at a picture book. And once, when she was learning to read, she caught snow that turned 
		into words. She made the words into a curious sentence: "Things aren't always what they seem, are they?" And more 
		recently, the strange events have increased. Fern observes a nun turn into a lamppost, and then during her 
		swimming class, she sees a bat become a pile of marbles! Fern can't tell her dull parents about these strange 
		sights. They already think she has an "overactive dysfunction" --- an imagination!
	</p>
	<p>
		One day, Fern's boring world is interrupted by a shocking surprise. Mary Curtain, the hospital nurse who 
		delivered Fern, arrives in tears. She tells the Drudgers that there's been a horrible mistake. Fern is not a 
		Drudger after all! She was switched at birth with a boy named Howard. Howard is with the nurse as well as a man, 
		Fern's father, who calls himself the Bone. A quick decision is made --- Fern will go with the Bone for the summer 
		and Howard will stay with the Drudgers.
	</p>

		As soon as Fern leaves with the Bone, her adventure begins. You see, the Bone is not like the Drudgers in the 
		least. When Fern gets in the car with the Bone and the nurse, she realizes that her summer will be anything but 
		boring. She learns that the Bone and her mother are Anybodies --- people who can turn into practically anybody. 
		Anybodies can also use hypnosis and deep concentration (mixed with a third "something else") to help other people 
		become better versions of themselves.
