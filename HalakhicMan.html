		Taken from this review.
	</a>
	<p>
		Had a hard time understanding parts of the book, but contains many deep and beautiful ideas to think about. 
		Not only to think about, but act as well, and that does seem to be a central purpose of the book. By thinking, 
		one can only get so far- real progress beyond that point can only come by actions, even if one doesn't 
		completely understand what to do and why to do it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As an engineering undergraduate studying a lot of math, I can really understand Soloveitchik's attitude towards 
		religion and Halakha by comparing it to the study of mathematics- you can only get so far by reading about math- 
		the real comprehension starts with action. And when starting a difficult and complex subject in math, you need a 
		lot of confidence and faith to believe you'll be able to understand it sufficiently.
	</p>
	<p>
		I find it a powerful, although difficult idea to come to terms with and live by.
