	<p>
		Rav Lichtenstein's words regarding the many roads to a life committed to mitzvah, his thoughts about the 
		dignity of work, the centrality of study are quite wonderful. In the final chapter, his argument for centrism, 
		complexity, and dialecticism is probably the most compelling of the book. It made me very happy to be where I 
		am. Here is a man who received his Rabbinic education from Rav Soloveichik and his PhD in English Literature 
		(focus on Milton) from Harvard. Lichtenstein embodies the kind of informed thoughtfulness AND passion For which 
		I strive.

		I found the chapters on faith (bitachon) and teshuva less compelling. I don't necessarily think this is Rav 
		Liechtenstein's fault, however. This book was adapted from a series of lectures, and the audience for content 
		of those chapters was Jewish educators. Thus, much of the discussion wound up being about the pedagogical 
		benefits or difficulties of differing positions on faith etc.
