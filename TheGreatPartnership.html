		Taken from this review.

	<p>
		A leading Jewish theologian argues that both religious fundamentalists and neo-Darwinian atheists such as 
		Richard Dawkins have it wrong when they contend that science and religious faith are incompatible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, Sacks (Covenant & Conversation: A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible Exodus, 2010, etc.), chief rabbi 
		of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, believes that both are necessary, complementary ways of 
		looking at the world. “Science takes things apart to see how they work,” he writes. “Religion puts things 
		together to see what they mean…neither is dispensable.” As a metaphor for this duality, the author uses the 
		distinction between right-brain intuitive processing and left-brain analytic functioning. Religious faith is 
		interpretative (“the search for meaning constitutes our humanity”), while scientific knowledge increases our 
		well-being. Sacks dismisses rage-filled, self-righteous biblical fundamentalism but also deplores the equally 
		intolerant stance of scientists like Dawkins, who has compared religious belief to a virus. Sacks refers to 
		traditional Jewish interpretations of the Bible to explain his own search for God in the bonds of family, the 
		small compassionate acts of people toward strangers and the necessity of challenging injustice. He views the 
		Creation as a work in progress begun billions of years ago by a God who “delights in diversity,” and he 
		interprets Darwin's “wondrous discovery” as showing that “the Creator made creation creative.” The author 
		compares his own Jewish view of God—consistent with the notion of emergence and evolution—to a literal 
		interpretation of Genesis and suggests that God has called upon us “to become his partners in the work of 
		redemption.” To accomplish this, he writes, we require “people capable of understanding cognitive pluralism."
	</p>
	<p>
		A brilliant exposition of the possibility of science and religion, each in its own way, contributing to a better 
		world.
